== Is it kosher to just use panic("Ahhh!");? ==

I'm looking through the code and I've found a number of *panic();* functions, my question is simply thus: it's kosher to use *panic("Error!");* or is there more to it due to Microkernel craziness?

== Coding Style ==

I've realized that I've been using a java-like coding style (xml documentation in comments that is). Is there a set coding style that I should be using?
