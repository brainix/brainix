#summary Switching from svn to a distributed Source Code Manager

= Introduction =

Subversion is nice, but I've been looking into [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control#Distributed_revision_control Distributed SCM's] lately and have been really impressed.  

= Details =

There are lots of open "distributed SCM"'s out there. eg.,
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29 Git]
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_%28software%29 Monotone]
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial_%28software%29 Mercurial]
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_arch GNU Arch]
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_revision_control_software .. and tons of others]

Has anyone discussed moving to such a system?

= Argon =

I'm currently developing a code.google.com clone which supports multiple SCM's.  Git is one of them.  One of my goals is to allow each developer of a project to have their own branch available online for people to merge with.

I'll probably never finish Argon, because I never finish anything. :/

I've created a code.google.com project for it: [http://code.google.com/p/argonproject/ Argon Project]
