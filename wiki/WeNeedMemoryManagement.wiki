#We Need Memory Management

= Introduction =

Whenever you try to run the Brainix OS now you will always get a page fault exception and then, well, so it goes.

We need to implement memory management for the Brainix OS is basically what I'm saying.

Hmm...lemme look up some sites on memory management.
There is the [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.os.development/search?group=alt.os.development&q=memory+management&qt_g=Search+this+group Alt.Os.Dev Google Search for Memory Management]
An article [http://www.enderunix.org/simsek/articles/memory.pdf Memory Management for Systems Programmers] (pdf).

For books:
There is _The Minix Book_ Chapter 4, _Understanding the Linux Kernel_ chapters 8 and 15, and Chapter 5 of _The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System version 5.2_.

So feel free for all to partake in the discussions.
